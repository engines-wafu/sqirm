## Simple Quality Risk and Issue Management

### Aim

This project is designed to provide a simple tool for use by organisations (in the example, an aviation engineering department) to understand risks and control them.

### Status

This project is in the early development stages.  Only a small proportion of the planned functionality is currently available.

### Functions

The tool pulls together the following elements to form a simple picture of organisational risks:

1. Risks (in the form of bowtie assessments).

2. Key performance indicators using either of the following:

   * Static, or user-entered data, and
   
   * Calculated data.
  
3. Actions and issues management.

4. Quality systems management.

### Hosting

The beta code is hosted at www.blackcataerospace.com.  Any data contained therein is for test purposes only.

### Contributions

Anyone can contribute to the develement of the code.  A SQL data dump of the database schema will be uploaded when its more mature.
